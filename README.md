# Pizza Orders UI

For your first mini project, you will be honing your HTML and CSS skills.

Using HTML and CSS, please recreate this static webpage:

## You will need to think about:

- **Head Elements**: What to include in the head, such as the title and meta tags.
- **Semantic Structure**: How to semantically arrange the body, header, main, and footer.
- **HTML Elements**: Which HTML elements to include, such as nav, links, different text elements, buttons, images, and sections.
- **CSS Styling**: Using CSS for styling, including flexbox.
- **Details**: Keep details such as fonts and hover states in mind.

You will need to find your own images. This example is just the minimum; if you would like to get extra creative with design, you can change up the colors, add additional elements such as an offers banner at the top, or even add some of the other pages.

Keep in mind there is a large workload with this course on top of the additional responsibilities you all have in your daily lives, so we expect no more than 5 hours to be spent on this mini project.

## Deadline

The deadline is 25/06. As always, let us know if you need any help or guidance. You will each be presenting your mini project to the class on 25/06.
